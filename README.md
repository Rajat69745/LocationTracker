## Acknowledgment and Thank You for the Assignment

## Dear Sunandita,
 ## I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to express my gratitude for the opportunity to work on the recent assignment. It was a valuable experience, and I appreciate the trust you placed in me to develop the location tracking functionality.



 ## In the course of the project, I employed the Geo location package to efficiently track user locations, integrated the maps package for a comprehensive map view, and utilized Async Storage to store essential user data. The permissions sought in the AndroidManifest file were ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION, ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION, and ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION to ensure a seamless and accurate location tracking experience for Android users.

 ## Given the absence of specific UI references in FIGMA or PNG, my primary focus was on implementing functionality. The application is ready to run with a simple NPM installation process. I believe the features implemented align with the project requirements and goals.






 ##  I am eager to receive your feedback on the work done. If there are any specific aspects you would like me to address or refine, please feel free to let me know. I am committed to delivering the best possible results and ensuring that the application meets your expectations.

##  Once again, thank you for this engaging assignment. I look forward to your positive reply and the possibility of collaborating on future projects.

## Best regards,
## Rajat SK
